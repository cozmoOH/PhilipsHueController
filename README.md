# PhilipsHueController

**All new versions for this app will be on the releases. The Main.py is V1**

This is a personal philips hue controller using tkinter.
To use, you must change the IP of the bridge and the names of the Philips hue lights.

(First Time Only) You must click the button on the Philips Hue Bridge (in 30secs) in order to use this application.

No .exe file releases since ip config is needed. Only .py files.

My plans
Alpha: Basic stuff
Beta: Better GUI
Release: Easier Setup from the app without changing the python file.
