# PhilipsHueController

**All new versions for this app will be on the releases. The Main.py is V1**

This is a personal philips hue controller using tkinter.
To use, you must change the IP of the bridge and the names of the Philips hue lights.

(First Time Only) You must click the button on the Philips Hue Bridge (in 30secs) in order to use this application.

No .exe file releases since ip config is needed. Only .py files.

**My Plans**

In alpha, I will focus on making new controls.

In Beta, I will try to get a better (friendly) GUI for this app

In Release, I will allow people to set their ip address on the app and let people search for lightbulbs.
